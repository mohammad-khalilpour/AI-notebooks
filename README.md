# Titanic Prediction with Gaussian Bias

This code repository contains a machine learning model created to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using Gaussian bias. The model utilizes a Gaussian bias approach to incorporate additional information and improve the accuracy of predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the famous Titanic dataset. It includes information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, cabin, and whether or not they survived the disaster. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set.

## Dependencies
To run the code successfully, the following dependencies are required:
- Python (version X.X.X)
- Pandas (version 1.5.3)
- NumPy (version 1.23.5) (not necessary)
- Scikit-learn (version 1.2.1)


6. The model will be trained using the training dataset, and predictions will be made on the test dataset.
7. The predicted survival outcomes for the passengers in the test dataset will be displayed.

## Results
The model will output the predicted survival outcomes for the passengers in the test dataset with 77.5 percent accuracy. These predictions are based on the Gaussian bias approach, which incorporates additional information to improve the accuracy of the model compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.
